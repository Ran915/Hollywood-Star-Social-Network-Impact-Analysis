## Hollywood-Star-Social-Network-Impact-Analysis
This is a project for the course DNSC 6215 Social Network Analytics 

Please refer to the .html or .Rmd version since it has explanations for the code. The .R version only has the original code.
#### Summary
In this project, I explored social relations within and between groups of Hollywood actors, directors and scriptwriters and researched the influence of Hollywood actorsâ€™ social network on their career success based on their sociability levels and their connections with influential figures using centrality methods in R.
